## Merge Requests

Merge requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding if I merge in a merge request I look at the following things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear about which problem you're trying to solve with your
contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the merge request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.

### Is it of good quality

- There are no spelling mistakes
- It reads well
- For English language contributions: Has a good score on [Grammarly](grammarly.com) or [Hemingway Editor](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/)

### Does it move this repository closer to my vision for the repository

The aim of this repository is documented at [README](README.md).

### Does it follow the contributor covenant

This repository has a [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), I will remove things that do not respect it.
